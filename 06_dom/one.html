<!-- dom is document object model , your html document is made of wich model and what is its structure and layout if we can understand this we can also understand how to maipulate it 

The Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface that represents a web page (HTML/XML) as a tree-like structure of objects (nodes), allowing scripts, primarily JavaScript, to access, manipulate, and change the document's content, structure, and style dynamically, making websites interactive

<!-- to select the specific element, we can get it from 
document.getElementById("title")
document.getElementByClass("Heading")
now when we have element then we can get information about it 
document.getElementById("title").id will give you id of that element 
document.getElementByClass("Heading").className will give you class of the element *** here we cannot write class we have to write className because internal system of js understand className not class
and we can also manapulate these id and class names and all 
if we want to change the content we can use 
document.getElementsById("title").innerText="aditya jain"
we can store const title=document.getElementsById("title")
and we can style this element 
title.style.backgroundColor="red"
title.style.borderRadius="10px"
we can get the content of element from 
title.innerText  this show the text which is visible only
title.textContent this give us complete text inside a element
title.innerHTML give us whole html value it support html tags also

document.queryselector('h2') it will give us the first h2 of documnet 

document.queryselector(#title)  to find according to id
document.queryselector(.heading) to get element according to class

people like queryselector very much because you can use css atribute in it all css selector we can use in it

const myul=document.querySelector('ul') it will select whole unorder list
const myli=myul.querySelector('li') this will store the the first li in ul 

for selecting the other one we have to use querySelectAll()
const items=myul.querySelectorAll('li')
now for selecting two it is items[1] like this 

now items is a nodelist and we can run loop and all on it 
nodelist is not exactly same as arry but some kind of similar
we can not do like items.style.backgroundColor='green' error
we have to write items[1].style.backgroundColor='green'
and if we want to green every item at one thime 
items.style.backgroundColor='green' wrong we have to use the loop
items.forEach((li)=>{               correct
    l1.style.backgroundColor='green'
})



htmlCollection dont have forEach or any other loop so we have to convert it into array 
const htmlcollection=document.querySelect('.list')
const arraycollection=Array.from(htmlcollection)
arraycollection.forEach((li)=>{
    li.style.color='green'
})
